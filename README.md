# Airline Delays

![](hero.jpg) 

## 1. Introduction
From an industry-wide perspective, delays contribute to congestion at airports, inefficient air traffic management, and increased environmental impact due to excessive fuel burn and carbon emissions. The economic consequences extend beyond airlines to include airports, ground service providers, and businesses dependent on timely air travel, such as logistics and tourism industries.

## 2. Problem Statement
Understanding the key factors contributing to delays - ranging from weather conditions, air traffic congestion, and mechanical issues to staffing shortages, security procedures, and airline scheduling inefficiencies - is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate their occurrence. By leveraging data analytics, predictive modeling, and real-time monitoring, stakeholders can identify patterns, anticipate potential disruptions, and implement proactive solutions.
This analysis focuses on:
- Identifying the busiest months and airports for flights.
- Determining months with the highest delay rates.
- Analyzing delay patterns across different airlines.
- Examining primary causes of delays.
- Evaluating geographical patterns in delay occurrences.

- **Power BI Parameters**: Implemented a dynamic parameter allowing users to select different delay and flight categories . This enhances interactivity and enables focused analysis based on user selection. 

## 4. Data Sourcing
The dataset used in this project consists of airline delay data, including:
- Flight details (Year, Month, Airline, Airport Code, Total Flights, Delays)
- Delay breakdown (Carrier, Weather, Late Aircraft, etc.)
- Additional airport and carrier information

The Dataset Provide by **FP20 Analytics**

## 5. Data Transformation
Data preprocessing was performed using Power Query, including:
- Cleaning and structuring data
- Creating a Calendar table for time-based analysis
- Adding an Airport table with `Airport Code`, `Airport Name`, and `Airport Location`
- Adding a Carrier table with `Carrier Name` and `Carrier SVG Image`

## 6. Modeling
A `Star Schema` relational data model was designed in Power BI with the following structure:
- **Fact Table:** `Airline Delays`
- **Dimension Tables:** `Calendar`, `Airport`, `Carrier`
- Relationships established between the fact and dimension tables
